# MiniProject
This is my project with Node JS

There is still a problem with the project, I am really sorry that i can finish all the test
But, i hope that i still have a chance to work with you guys. i'm willing to work harder and harder than before.

Thank you.

For run the project you can unzip the node_modules folder and run it with access through http://localhost:3000
